## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}

```

```{r include=FALSE}
# There is an error in the code below so I took it out for now.
# > Word count: `r wordcountaddin::word_count()`
```
