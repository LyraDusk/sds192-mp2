## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}

# Lauren setting up the Contributions Table
contributions_clean <- contributions %>%
  filter(transaction_type == "24A" | transaction_type == "24E") %>%
  filter(transaction_amt > 0) %>%
  spread(transaction_type, transaction_amt, fill = 0) %>%
  rename(against = "24A") %>%
  rename(support = "24E") %>%
  select(cand_id, against, support) %>%
  group_by(cand_id) %>%
  summarize(total_for = sum(support), total_against = sum(against))


```

```{r include=FALSE}
# There is an error in the code below so I took it out for now.
# > Word count: `r wordcountaddin::word_count()`
```
